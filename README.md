# The Butcher's Almanac
A very naive weather predicter that predicts the weather based on yearly averages. 
Probably worse than the Farmer's Almanac.

## About
This project is divided into two main sections, the CSV parser and the actual almanac. The almananic is the meat of the system, and does 70% of the work. It contains the algorithm, and the frontend that runs the algorithm from the data. The actual data is parsed by the CSV parser, which takes in a raw CSV file and converts it into a properly formatted Javascript file. Why JavaScript? I don't know, probably ask SFFDesigns, he's the one who wanted it.
Also, we got the data from NCDC.

## Why?
This was done for the Maine App Challenge, and we thought it would be a decent project.
